# Voting System Smart Contract (Error Handling)
An overview, instructions, and information about the error handling mechanisms used in the "Voting System Smart Contract" project.

## Description

The "Voting System Smart Contract" is a Solidity smart contract that enables voting functionality while incorporating error handling mechanisms. It allows users to cast votes for candidates and maintains a vote count for each candidate. The contract includes age verification to ensure only eligible voters can participate.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the "Voting System Smart Contract", follow these steps:

1. Download the Solidity compiler and development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat).
2. Create a new Solidity file and copy the code into the file.

### Executing Program

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract on a compatible blockchain network using your chosen development environment.
2. Connect your chosen user interface (e.g., DApp, web application) to the deployed smart contract.
3. Use the provided functions to interact with the contract, such as `vote()` to cast a vote and `getResult()` to retrieve vote counts.

## Error Handling

The "Voting System Smart Contract" implements the following error handling mechanisms:

- The `require()` statement is used to validate conditions and ensure specific requirements are met. For example, it is used to check if a voter has already voted and to verify that the amount being deposited is greater than zero.
- The `assert()` statement is utilized for internal consistency checks. It helps catch and handle logical errors. In the context of the contract, it is used to ensure that the vote count for a candidate is greater than zero.
- The `revert()` statement is employed to handle exceptional cases or invalid conditions. For instance, it is used to revert the transaction if the age verification fails, or if the division result is zero during vote counting.

These error handling mechanisms help maintain the integrity and security of the contract by enforcing constraints and preventing undesirable or unintended behavior.
