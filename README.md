# Decentralized Banking System Smart Contract(Error Handling)
An overview, instructions, and information about the error handling mechanisms used in the "Decentralized Banking System Smart Contract" project.

## Description

The "Decentralized Banking System Smart Contract" is a Solidity smart contract that enables banking functionality while incorporating error handling mechanisms. It allows users to withdraw, deposit or check bank balances for each candidate.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the "Decentralized Banking System Smart Contract", follow these steps:

1. Download the Solidity compiler and development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat).
2. Create a new Solidity file and copy the code into the file.

### Executing Program

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract on a compatible blockchain network using your chosen development environment.
2. Connect your chosen user interface (e.g., DApp, web application) to the deployed smart contract.
3. Use the provided functions to interact with the contract, such as `deposit()` to cast a vote and `withdraw()` to retrieve a real time balance.

## Error Handling

The "Decentralized Banking System Smart Contract" implements the following error handling mechanisms:

- The `require()` function is used to validate that the deposit amount is greater than zero and ensures that users cannot deposit zero or a negative amount, which would not make sense and could indicate an error in user input or malicious intent.
- The `assert()` function is utilized for internal consistency checks. It helps catch and handle logical errors. In the context of the contract, it is used to ensure that the current balance for a user is greater than zero.
- The `revert()` function is employed to handle exceptional cases or invalid withdrawals. For instance, to provide a custom error message if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to zero and clearly communicates why the transaction failed, helping users understand what went wrong.

These error handling mechanisms help maintain the integrity and security of the contract by enforcing constraints and preventing undesirable or unintended behavior.
